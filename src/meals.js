      "Most British recipes for Boston baked beans just use a piece of pork belly, but we think it needs some salted or smoked meat to counteract the sweetness, so we include bacon or pancetta. We’ve based the recipe on one our mothers used to make – when they weren’t opening a tin. The alcohol isn’t authentic, but adds flavour (we’ve tried all three). \nThis takes a long time to cook, but once it’s in the oven there’s nothing more to do. It makes quite a large amount and can be reheated the next day for your breakfast, brunch, lunch or supper. We think it makes the most wonderful cooked breakfast or side dish with sausages.\n",

It’s not too much to claim for it: it’s almost ridiculously easy to make – I relish the quiet ceremony of its slow-cooking preparation – and it’s both comforting and enlivening to eat.\nYou do need to plan for it, as the gorgeous broth has to be made a day in advance (longer if you want), but it’s a very straightforward procedure once you’ve got the key ingredients in stock.",
